### Hi, I'm HarsimranðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, and an aspiring Software Engineer. My skills lay in Python and C++ development, with cryptography and machine learning peaking my interests. I've completed a co-op work term at Sun Life Financial, and two at the Department of National Defence. 

I'm also working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the University of Waterloo. My research involves looking into post-quantum cryptography primitives for existing blockchain models!
